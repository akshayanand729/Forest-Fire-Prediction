# Forest-Fire-Prediction
**Introduction**

We live in difficult times. Both the year 2019 and 2020 (up to the present) have been a pretty rough ride. From the forest fires of the Amazon as well as Australia to the Coronavirus pandemic, we've had our fair share of disturbing global events.

Portugal registered around 12,200 wildfires last year, compared to an average of 20,000 blazes per year recorded between 2009 and 2018. With tools like data science and machine learning empowering humankind, it's essential that such tools are put to good use in order to help pick out the conditions that lead to the maximum amount of damage (in our case, in terms of burnt area) during such forest fire incidents.

Presented in this competition is a dataset consisting of the meteorological and other related conditions during 367 forest fire incidents in Portugal between 2009 and 2018. Your task is to predict the burnt area during the forest fire incidents based on the given conditions.

**Why is this contest challenging?**

From a data science/machine learning perspective, you only have access to 367 instances for learning the relationship between meteorological and other conditions with the burnt or damaged area. Also, most of the target values are so small that they tend to 0, which calls for special treatment of the target attribute. Hint: Get creative with transformations and feature engineering! Also with such a small amount of data, intelligent exploratory data analysis will be your most important tool.
